## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No notifications appearing"
**Check:**
```bash
# 1. Is backend running?
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users
# Should return: {"error":"Access token required"}

# 2. Check database
psql -U postgres -d flowspace -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM notifications;"
```

### "Notifications not being created"
**Check backend console for errors:**
- Look for database connection errors
- Check for SQL syntax errors
- Verify UUID generation is working

### "Wrong users getting notifications"
**Verify user roles:**
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, is_active FROM users;
```
